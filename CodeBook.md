This is the course project for Getting and Cleaning Data on Coursera.

It contains the following files:

README.md
run_analysis.R
CodeBook.md
tidy.txt
run_analysis.R downloads data from the UCI HAR dataset, representing data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone, and performs the following analysis:

Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
Creates a second, independent tidy data set (tidy.txt) with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
CodeBook.md contains information on all the variables used and summaries calculated, along with other relevant information.

tidy.txt is the tidy dataset.
